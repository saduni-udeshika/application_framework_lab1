Objective: Teach a set of basic concepts in the JavaScript programming language.
Prerequisites: Students should have basic JavaScript knowledge.

1. Create a function as a variable (function expression) that prints ‘Hello World’ to console

   the function should be executed as a function inside the body. Call the second function

   the results.
   e. Correct the getVehicleName to print out the global variable vehicleName using
   the 'this' keyword
4. Create a separate function using JavaScript closure which accepts the tax percentage
   and returns a function that accepts the amount and returns the amount after adding tax
   percentage. Try adding tax percentage to ‘this’ object and check if it works.
